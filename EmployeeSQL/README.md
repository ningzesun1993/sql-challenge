Create an image file of your ERD:

I use a screenshot of the app in the website. Seems I cannot export as an image.

Create a .sql file of your table schemata.

This is named as table_schemata.sql which is basically just the exported file from website

Create a .sql file of your queries.

This is named as anaylsis.sql.

(Optional) Create a Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis.

This is named as bonus. I have an issue running the docker and pgadmin. Instead I download it and run it, so the input is kind of weird.
